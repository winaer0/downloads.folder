The downloads folder is the location on your computer or mobile device where files, installers, and other content downloaded from the internet are placed. It may store content temporarily or permanently, depending on your preferences. This guide covers everything Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS users need to know about it, including how to find it and how to change where your downloads are stored.

## Where to Find the Downloads Folder on a Mac 

To find downloads on macOS, open Finder by selecting the Finder icon in the Dock. From the column on the left-hand side of the Finder window, select Downloads. You should see a list of all files downloaded to your device.

## Where to Find the Downloads Folder on a PC

To open your downloads folder on a Windows 10 device, click the File Explorer icon on your taskbar, then select the Downloads folder on the left-hand side.

## Where to Find the Downloads Folder on Android

* Swipe up from the bottom of your device's home screen to access the app drawer.
* Select Files
* Select the menu icon in the top left of the screen, then select Downloads.

Selecting Downloads brings up the files you've downloaded from the internet. However, with certain apps (such as Google Play TV & Movies and WhatsApp), the files and content you download are saved directly to them, rather than the Downloads folder. As a result, you need to open them and, in most cases, open their menus or settings to access downloaded content.
